# About

**UserOwnIoT** is founded on the belief that technology should empower, not control.
Our mission is to design and build IoT devices that embody the principles of:

- **Freedom** – You own your data, your devices, and your choices.
- **Openness** – Fully transparent designs, open-source firmware, and open standards.
- **Self-Sufficiency** – Products designed to be repaired, modified, and improved by their owners.
- **Sustainability** – Long-lasting hardware, locally sourced components, and minimal environmental footprint.
- **Simplicity** – Straightforward, functional designs without unnecessary complexity.

We envision a world where connected devices respect privacy, are easy to maintain, and remain useful for years—not months.
Every product we create is a step towards a more independent, responsible, and transparent technological future.

## Why We Exist
In a market dominated by locked-down, short-lived, cloud-dependent products, the user’s control is often the first thing to disappear.
We believe technology should work for people, not the other way around.
Our goal is to return ownership of devices and data back to where it belongs – in the hands of the user.

## How We Build
We combine open-source hardware designs with firmware that can be easily inspected, updated, and adapted.
Whenever possible, we choose components manufactured in Europe, supporting local industry and reducing supply chain risks.
We design for repairability, avoiding proprietary parts that force premature replacements.

Our development process uses open and accessible tools:

- **GitHub** – for source code hosting and project collaboration
- **Visual Studio Code** – for firmware development
- **KiCad** – for PCB design
- **ThinkerCad** – for enclosure parts modeling
- **Prusa 3D printers** – for manufacturing custom enclosures

## The Future We Want
We see a future where every smart device can be understood, repaired, and trusted.
Where communities can share improvements freely, and where technology grows alongside its users instead of being thrown away.
We’re building products for people who value control, reliability, and long-term usability.
