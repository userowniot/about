Our mission is to design and build IoT devices that embody the principles of:</p> <ul> <li>Freedom \u2013 You own your data, your devices, and your choices.</li> <li>Openness \u2013 Fully transparent designs, open-source firmware, and open standards.</li> <li>Self-Sufficiency \u2013 Products designed to be repaired, modified, and improved by their owners.</li> <li>Sustainability \u2013 Long-lasting hardware, locally sourced components, and minimal environmental footprint.</li> <li>Simplicity \u2013 Straightforward, functional designs without unnecessary complexity.</li> </ul> <p>We envision a world where connected devices respect privacy, are easy to maintain, and remain useful for years\u2014not months. Every product we create is a step towards a more independent, responsible, and transparent technological future.</p>"},{"location":"#why-we-exist","title":"Why We Exist","text":"<p>In a market dominated by locked-down, short-lived, cloud-dependent products, the user\u2019s control is often the first thing to disappear. We believe technology should work for people, not the other way around. Our goal is to return ownership of devices and data back to where it belongs \u2013 in the hands of the user.</p>"},{"location":"#how-we-build","title":"How We Build","text":"<p>We combine open-source hardware designs with firmware that can be easily inspected, updated, and adapted. Whenever possible, we choose components manufactured in Europe, supporting local industry and reducing supply chain risks. We design for repairability, avoiding proprietary parts that force premature replacements.</p> <p>Our development process uses open and accessible tools:</p> <ul> <li>GitHub \u2013 for source code hosting and project collaboration</li> <li>Visual Studio Code \u2013 for firmware development</li> <li>KiCad \u2013 for PCB design</li> <li>ThinkerCad \u2013 for enclosure parts modeling</li> <li>Prusa 3D printers \u2013 for manufacturing custom enclosures</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#the-future-we-want","title":"The Future We Want","text":"<p>We see a future where every smart device can be understood, repaired, and trusted. Where communities can share improvements freely, and where technology grows alongside its users instead of being thrown away. We\u2019re building products for people who value control, reliability, and long-term usability.</p>"},{"location":"contact/","title":"Contact","text":"<p> Email: userowniot@gmail.com</p> <p> GitHub: https://github.com/userowniot/</p>"},{"location":"projects/","title":"Projects","text":"<p>Here you will find examples of current and upcoming projects:</p> <ul> <li>\ud83c\udf00 ESP32/ESPHome modules for Home Assistant</li> <li>\ud83d\udce1 STM32WB Zigbee devices with full local control</li> <li>\u2699 Open-source PCB designs available on GitHub</li> </ul>"}]}
